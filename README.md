- 👋 Hi, I’m @inti-ferreira
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, on front-end I've already learned the React framework, and some CSS-in-JS technologies such as Styled Components,
    Material UI and Chakra UI, among other libraries that makes the job easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for back-end, and frameworks such as Flask and Django. For databases my first choices were PostgreSQL for relational DB and
    MongoDB for no-SQL DB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects or Startups who have a good and positive culture. I'm not too money-driven, but I can't pretend I live in
    a pollyanna world, so a fair wage for meet my basics needs is essential.
